# Connect 4 Project


# Overview
For project #1, I created a game of Connect 4.

Once players come to the site, they are asked if it is a 1 player or 2 player game. If one player input one name, if two players then both names. Once name(s) are inputted, you can choose the emoji avatar off the list. Now its time to play the game. The goal of the game is to get 4 of your emojis in a line whether it is vertical, horizontal, or diagonal before your opponent.

I used https://www.photocollage.com/ to make the background for the landing page. I saw a photo like that but all of them had watermarks. So I made my own.
